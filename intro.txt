Welcome to Bulls and Cows! 
Your goal is to either guess a number, or help the computer guess yours.
you will be prompted to pick a game mode: Guess or Host.

In Guess mode, the computer provides you with clues, and you guess.
Select the number of digits, and the computer will generate a number with that many digits.
Begin playing by guessing a number with that many digits, 
and the computer will help you from there.
Any correct number present in your guess, but not in the right spot in the sequence is a COW.
If it is in the right spot, it is a BULL.
