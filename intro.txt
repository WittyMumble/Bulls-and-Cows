Welcome to Bulls and Cows! 
Your goal is to guess a number:
The computer knows it,
But YOU don't....

The computer provides you with clues that should lead you to finding the number.
Select the number of digits, and the computer will generate a number with that many digits.
Begin playing by guessing a number with that many digits, 
and the computer will help you from there.
Any correct number present in your guess, but not in the right spot in the sequence is a COW.
If it is in the right spot, it is a BULL.
